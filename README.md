# Project Overview

The project aims to provide stock price predictions for a given ticker symbol using historical stock data. The web application allows users to input a ticker symbol, and it retrieves the corresponding stock data using the Yahoo Finance API. The application then utilizes two models to predict future stock prices: a traditional machine learning model and a bi-directional LSTM model. The predicted prices are displayed on a web page along with historical price charts and other stock information.
